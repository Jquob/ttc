# My-TTC UI
## Description
My-TTC UI is a simple and clean ui developed for the My-TTC ui system hosted at [myttc.ca](https://myttc.ca/)
I made the UI both out of a need for a modern way to check when my bus would come without using massive amounts of mobile data, and as a school project!
## Supported Platforms
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - Android
  - Web
  - Mac/IOS (as a webapp, native support might come later)
## Development details
The UI uses JQuery-4.0 (beta), i chose JQuery because its what i know best!
I chose Tailwindcss for the styling just to simplify the coding and make it responsive easier.
## How to install!
For Users:
  you can install the:
    Apk for Android,
    zip or msi for Windows
    tar.gz or AppImage for Linux
    Mac OS/IOS support soon?
    you can also use the website, but it is not reccomended because uptime on my server is not very good :/

Developers:
  You can host the website using any webserver and by serving the ./www/ directory to users
  building the apps from scratch is already configured, you just need apache cordova, run "cordova build android --debug" and "cordova build electron --release".
